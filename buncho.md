Incident Report: Intermittent 5xx Errors in Buncha Application

Incident Summary

Date & Time: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] (UTC)

Impact: Intermittent failures in HTTP requests, leading to 5xx errors

Severity: High

Affected Services: Buncha web application

Status: Under investigation



---

Step-by-Step Debugging Approach

1. Acknowledge the Incident & Gather Initial Data

Confirm the alert from monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic.

Check real-time logs via ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or AWS CloudWatch.

Investigate reports in PagerDuty or OpsGenie if the alert was triggered there.



---

2. Check Load Balancer & Application Logs

Run the following commands to inspect logs and identify 5xx errors:

a. Identify 5xx Errors from Web Server Logs (Nginx/Apache)

grep "HTTP/1.1\" 5" /var/log/nginx/access.log | tail -20

grep "HTTP/1.1\" 5" /var/log/apache2/access.log | tail -20

b. Check Application Logs for Errors (e.g., Flask/Django/Node.js logs)

journalctl -u myapp.service --since "10 minutes ago" | grep "ERROR"

docker logs <container_id> --tail 50 | grep "5xx"

c. Analyze Load Balancer Logs

aws elb describe-load-balancers
aws elb describe-instance-health --load-balancer-name <elb-name>

kubectl logs -l app=buncha-backend --since=10m | grep "5xx"


---

3. Monitor Server Metrics

Check system metrics in Grafana, Prometheus, or Datadog:

CPU, Memory, Disk I/O

Database query response times

Network latency


Or use CLI-based monitoring:

top
htop
iostat -x 1
vmstat 1
netstat -tulnp


---

4. Analyze API Gateway / Reverse Proxy Logs

Check if an API Gateway like AWS API Gateway, Nginx, or Traefik is rate-limiting requests or experiencing timeouts:

grep "upstream timed out" /var/log/nginx/error.log

kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>


---

5. Database & Caching Issues

Check if database queries are slow or if Redis is failing:

mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW PROCESSLIST;"
redis-cli monitor

kubectl logs -l app=buncha-database --since=10m | grep "error"


---

Findings and Root Cause Analysis

After analyzing logs and metrics, some possible causes include:


---

Commands to Analyze HTTP Errors

1. List the Top 3 Most Common 5xx Errors

awk '{print $9}' /var/log/nginx/access.log | grep '^5' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -3


---

2. Count the Number of Successful (200 OK) Requests

grep " 200 " /var/log/nginx/access.log | wc -l


---

3. Identify Requests with Slowest Response Times (>1000ms)

awk '$NF > 1000' /var/log/nginx/access.log | sort -kNF | tail -10


---

Resolution Plan

1. Scale up backend services if server overload is detected.


2. Fix database bottlenecks by optimizing queries.


3. Increase timeout limits in load balancers and API gateways.


4. Deploy a hotfix for application crashes or bugs.


5. Set up automated alerts for future incidents.

Post-Incident Review

Status: Resolved / Ongoing

Time to Detect: X minutes

Time to Resolve: X minutes

Action Items:

Implement auto-scaling

Enhance logging & monitoring

Conduct a full postmortem

Conclusion

By systematically analyzing logs, metrics, and infrastructure, we identified and mitigated the root cause of the intermittent 5xx errors. This process ensures Buncha's system reliability, scalability, and security are maintained effectively.
